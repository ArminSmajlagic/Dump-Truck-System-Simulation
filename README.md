<h1>Dump-Truck-System-Simulation</h1>

<h2>Simulation Description</h2>

Simulation of dump truck company delivery system as a queueiny system in C++. Input data is being generated by random variate generators (following statistical distributions) using acceptance-rejection &amp; inverse-transformation techniques. 

Both radnom variate generator and simulation are programmed in c++ using OOP and data structure queue.
Goal is to estimate the performance messurements of loaders and weighters such as utilization coefficients.
Other statistics are being monitored :
- mean, 
- variance,
- standard diviation.

Results are being calculated from one cycle of simulation.

<h2> Simulation Input Data </h2>

As simulation input data i used random variate generator that i wrote in C++ which outputs random numbers respecting certain distributions.
For my simulation i used uniform and weibull distribution to generate times of loading, weighting and traveling.
